We study the problem of community detection in noisy stochastic block models. We focus on two types of noise: (1) geometric noise where a latent-space kernel affects edge formation, and (2) Erdős–Rényi model censoring where edges are masked independently. We present a new algorithm DuoSpec that de-noises the network to a pristine stochastic block model structure for better community recovery. We demonstrate on synthetic data that our algorithm outperforms existing community detection methods on noisy models. We test our algorithm on the Amazon metadata dataset and demonstrate strong results on community detection.
